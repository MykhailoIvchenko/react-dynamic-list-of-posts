1. The project implements React application for posts fethed from Mate academy server displaying.
First of all you'll see titles of all the existing posts and userId of the post author. There is a select
which allows you to choose a user to display only his/her posts. If you click 'open' button post details
(post's main text and comments (if exist)) appear in the side bar. There is a button for hiding and showing
comments (button is hidden if there are no any comments) here and form for adding new comment.
You can add new comment after form filling or delete existing comment by clicking 'x' in the comment field.

2. Technologies stack: HTML5, CSS3, SASS (I was provided with ready markup and SCSS), JS, TS, React.

4. Be noted that posts and comments are created by mentors and students for learning purposes and they
don't have any meaning. They could be just an array of some symols, so it is not a mistake. It is ok.
Users are not fetched from server, so user selection may not work is someone ruines right user ids in
displayed posts.
